# Overview of the framework

This Framework uses Maven Build Automation Tool And Maven Project Setup For Selenium. Eclipse which is a  integrated development environment (IDE) has been used for developing applications and java is used as a programming language.The Automation framework is a Page Object Model (POM) which is a design pattern,  that creates Object Repository for web UI elements.  For each web page in the application, there is a corresponding Page Class. This Page class will identify the WebElements of that web page and also contains Page methods which perform operations on those WebElements.Package for Page Object Classes are saved under 
src\internal\pageobjects

Correspondingly, we are saving the test cases under a different package(Called test here)
src\test\features

The framework implements The TestNG framework for generating reports and is integrated with Jenkins tool.
The Framework can be run in Chrome and Edge browsers
